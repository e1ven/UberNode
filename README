Ubernode.org was a project I made in 2006 to centralize machines, as part of the Freenet project.

The Freenet project didn't yet have what is now called Opennet, which is what allows people who don't know each other to connect and share a network.

Ubernode was one server that everyone could connect to, have it route messages and stores, and generally act as a big file-dump for the internet.
